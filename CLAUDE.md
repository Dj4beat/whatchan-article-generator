## What This Project Is

A multi-sport AI article generator for the WhatChan sports network (whatchan.co.uk).
Written and owned by **Adrian Dane**.

The tool generates fully formatted, WordPress-ready HTML articles from:
- Live RSS news feeds (click any headline → Generate)
- A pasted URL (fetches and rewrites any article)
- Evergreen topics and match-specific templates (Match Preview, Match Review, Fixtures)
- Custom Topics with expert journalist templates and optional club selection

Supported sports: Football, Darts, Boxing, Snooker, Formula 1, Rugby, Other.

**White Label mode** — produce unbranded articles for other domains/clients, with a custom author name (or fully anonymous), no banners, and domain-specific schema.

## Generation Pipeline

Every article goes through this pipeline. **Accuracy is the top priority** — accuracy over speed, accuracy over completeness.

### Standard Pipeline (News Feed / URL / Evergreen)

1. **Verify** — `RESEARCH_MODEL` (Perplexity Sonar Pro) searches the live web. Verifies managers, player status, results, standings. Output: `VERIFIED CURRENT FACTS`. Fails gracefully.
2. **Analyse** — `FREE_MODEL` extracts key facts. Web-verified facts marked `[VERIFIED]` and prioritised.
3. **Write** — Selected model writes full HTML article. Time-sensitive facts ONLY from context.
4. **Hallucination scan** — `FREE_MODEL` compares draft against source. Categories: `current_manager`, `current_club`, `current_status`, `fake_quote`, `truncated_quote`, `invented_stat`, `invented_name`, `placeholder`, `generic_filler`, `fabricated_quote`. Stripped automatically. **Findings saved to feedback memory.**
5. **QC + SEO** — Source-traceability check with auto-retry loop (see below). SEO fields generated separately.
6. **E-E-A-T polish** — Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness enhancement.

### Match Article Pipeline (Match Preview / Match Review)

When a club is selected + category is "Match Previews" or "Match Reports":

1. **Research** — `preResearchMatch()` via Perplexity Sonar Pro finds specific fixture/result data (opponent, date, score, form, H2H, injuries, managers, TV). Demands "NOT FOUND" for missing data — never generic statements.
2. **Reference sites** — `fetchReferenceSites()` auto-scrapes **in parallel** with step 1:
   - `premierinjuries.com/injury-table.php` — injury data
   - `rotowire.com/soccer/lineups.php` — expected lineups
   - `live-footballontv.com` — UK TV broadcast listings
3. **Stats** — `fetchMatchStats()` via Perplexity pulls WhoScored / FootyStats / SoccerStats data.
4. **Write** — With CRITICAL ACCURACY RULES: every sentence must contain a specific fact; omit sections without real data; no generic filler; quotes must be real.
5. **Hallucination scan** — same as standard but findings saved to feedback memory.
6. **QC + auto-retry** — up to 3 attempts (see below).
7. **E-E-A-T polish**.

### Auto-Retry QC Loop (`retryUntilPass`)

QC-FAIL articles **never reach the editor without exhausting automated fixes**:

```
Write → QC
  → PASS → E-E-A-T
  → FAIL → rewrite with ALL accumulated issues → QC (attempt 2)
    → PASS → E-E-A-T
    → FAIL → rewrite with ALL accumulated issues → QC (attempt 3)
      → PASS → E-E-A-T
      → FAIL → save all issues to feedback memory → surface with red badge
```

Each retry carries the **full accumulated issues** from every previous pass. Issues are deduplicated. Feedback is saved whether QC passes on retry or exhausts all attempts.

## Football Category Templates

14 expert journalist templates auto-fill the Custom Topic description when a category is selected with Football as the sport. Written from combined perspectives:
- **Editor** — angles, completeness, what readers need
- **Football Expert** — tactical depth, specific stats to source
- **Writer** — narrative structure, how to open each section
- **QC Agent** — verifiability, what must be confirmed not assumed

Templates: Season Analysis, Transfer News, Injury Updates, Competition Guides, Broadcaster Guides, Team Guides, Manager Features, Player Features, Match Previews, Match Reports, Club News, Awards, Fan Features, Fixture Analysis.

Templates use `[CLUB]` placeholder replaced with the selected club name. Auto-fill only triggers if the textarea is empty or was previously auto-filled (user edits are never overwritten).

---

## Feedback Memory (Learning System)

### Storage: Cloudflare Workers KV

Permanent, cross-device, edge-distributed. No TTL — entries persist forever.

**Worker routes:**
- `GET /api/feedback` — returns all entries from KV
- `POST /api/feedback` — adds entry with deduplication
- `DELETE /api/feedback` — clears all entries (admin)

**KV namespace:** `FEEDBACK` (id: `5b31d7cca89744d0a9761e302eb19436`)

**Frontend:** `loadFeedbackFromServer()` fetches at init → caches in `S.feedbackMemory`. `saveFeedbackEntry()` POSTs to server + updates cache. Falls back to localStorage if offline.

### Entry Schema

```javascript
{
  id: 'fb-1712345678000-a3x9',
  category: 'Match Previews',
  typeId: 'preview',
  sport: 'football',
  model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
  source: 'human' | 'auto-hallucination' | 'auto-qc-corrected' | 'auto-qc-exhausted',
  articleTitle: 'Manchester United vs Leeds...',
  feedback: 'Too much generic filler...',
  qcIssues: [{ severity: 'critical', description: '...' }],
  timestamp: 1712345678000
}
```

### What Triggers Feedback Saves

| Trigger | Source type | When |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Hallucination scan strips items | `auto-hallucination` | Every scan that finds items (4 locations) |
| QC passes on retry 2 or 3 | `auto-qc-corrected` | Retry succeeds but issues were found |
| QC exhausts all 3 attempts | `auto-qc-exhausted` | All retries failed |
| Human clicks Feedback button | `human` | Editor provides specific notes |

### Model-Aware Learning

`buildFeedbackLessons(currentModel)` produces two tiers:

| Scenario | Framing in prompt |
|----------|------------------|
| Same model made the mistake | **YOUR DIRECT FEEDBACK:** (harshest — repeating = critical failure) |
| Different model made it | **SHARED KNOWLEDGE (from [model name]):** (advisory — but repeating after warning is worse) |

Injected into:
- `getSystemPrompt()` → "EDITORIAL LESSONS LEARNED"
- `getQcSystem()` → "HISTORICAL EDITORIAL FEEDBACK — EXTRA STRICT, automatic FAIL"

### Human Feedback UI

Purple **Feedback** button on every article card. Opens a collapsible panel with:
- Textarea for editorial notes
- **Reprocess Article** button → runs full pipeline: rewrite with feedback → hallucination scan → QC (with retry loop) → E-E-A-T → SEO
- Article updates **in place** (same index in `S.generated`)
- Feedback saved to KV before reprocessing begins
- `feedbackHistory` array on the article object tracks all editorial notes

## Match Preview / Report Quality Rules

### Banned Phrases (in match articles — automatic QC failure)

"both teams will be looking to", "is expected to be", "could pose challenges", "promises to be an exciting", "eager to", "determined to make their mark", "will aim to leverage", "the outcome often hinges on", "tactical discipline being key", "a closely fought encounter", "will be looking to impose their style", "according to recent reports", "data suggests"

### Section Omission Rule

If a section (e.g. Team News) has no specific data from the research, it must be **omitted entirely** — never filled with generic text. A shorter article with real facts beats a longer article with waffle.

### Pullquote Rule

Must be a REAL quote from a real person in the source. If no quotes exist, use a strong stat (e.g. "W4 D0 L1 — Team's record in the last 5 home matches") with the source as attribution. Never fabricate quotes.

### Reference Sites (auto-fetched for football match articles)

| Site | Data provided |
|------|--------------|
| `premierinjuries.com/injury-table.php` | PL injury table — player names, injury types, return dates |
| `rotowire.com/soccer/lineups.php` | Expected lineups for EPL, UCL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, MLS |
| `live-footballontv.com` | UK TV channel, kick-off time, streaming options |

## Article Object Schema

```javascript
{
  spec: { title, category, keywords, team, typeId, isTopical, source },
  wp: '...WordPress HTML block...',
  seo: { h1, titleOptions, metaOptions, urlSlug, tags, keyphrases, keyphraseMatches, allKeywords },
  status: 'done',
  articleLength: 'standard' | 'medium' | 'longform' | 'custom',
  qc: { verdict, confidence, issues, verified_facts },
  model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash',
  matchContext: '...truncated research context for reprocessing...',
  feedbackHistory: [{ text, timestamp }],
  needsReview: false,
  wasRewritten: false,
  eeatPolished: true,
  savedAt: 1712345678000,
  wlOptions: null | { domain, author, noBanners }
}
```

---

## SEO Fields

`genSeoFields(spec, articleBody)` receives the article draft body so keyphrases are grounded in actual content.

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| `h1` | Keyword-rich headline, under 80 chars |
| `titleOptions` | 5 SEO title options, 50-65 chars each |
| `metaOptions` | 2 meta description options, 120-160 chars |
| `urlSlug` | Keyword-first, lowercase, hyphenated |
| `tags` | Up to 10 tags |
| `keyphrases` | 3 focus keyphrases, verified verbatim in article |
| `allKeywords` | 10-15 individual keywords |

---

## White Label Mode

Toggled via the **White Label** checkbox. Sets `CURRENT_WL` at pipeline start.

Effects: author override or anonymous (no byline/editors-note), domain override in schema, banners suppressed, blue badge on card, `wlOptions` persisted on article object.

---

## DOCX Export

Available on every article card. Uses `html-docx-js` CDN. `buildCleanHtml(wp)` strips SEO/schema/banners/tags, converts pullquotes to blockquotes. `downloadDocx(idx)` triggers download.
